# Dr. Hermann Gundert

{{The collection of my public notes on the life and ministry of Dr. Hermann Gundert, a German missionary linguist to Kerala}}

## Introduction

Gundert's was a familiar name to me from my childhood. However I never had any details about him until a decade ago. Then I found his [biography published](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Life_of_Hermann_Gundert_1896.pdf) in 1896 by Basel Mission. It is then I learned more about him. I was fascinated by his life and what he could do in his life. More than that, I realized that even though I had very little knowledge about him, he in fact influenced me. So I began to [digitize](https://ml.wikisource.org/wiki/%E0%B4%A4%E0%B4%BE%E0%B5%BE:The_Life_of_Hermann_Gundert_1896.pdf/5) the book in 2014.

In 2015 [Shiju Alex](www.shijualex.in) told me about an [exciting project to digitize the entire Malayalam books in the Gundert collection](https://shijualex.in/category/gundert-legacy-project/) found in Tubingen University. Participating in this project gave me even more opportunity to get to know that great man of God.

Since then I asked several of my friends, who are good writers, to write an updated biography of Gundert. However, it never worked out. Once I mentioned this to Babychayan, Nerveedhi and he encouraged me to write it myself. I was hesitant, but knowing the importance of the resources I possess I reluctantly agreed to write it.

My initial attempt was to update the Malayalam of the 1894 biography. Soon I got access to another book and later a collection of letters by Gundert. Hence I started doing a lot more reading about the man before preparing the articles for Nerveedhi.

Apart from the article itself, you will find the collection of my notes in these pages.
